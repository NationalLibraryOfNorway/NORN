# NORN Corpuses

This folder contains three corpus defintions in excel files: 

1. [Consensus corpus](./consensus_corpus_annotated.xlsx)
2. [1800-1839](./1800-1839_metadata.xlsx) 
3. [1840-1869](./1840-1869_metadata.xlsx)

The consensus corpus has been manually curated via literature history reference works, 
and each title has been annotated with how the works are described in the litature histories
(as a national romantic work, poetic realism, or similar).
